Everything I have engaged in so far has all been driven by my keen interest in developing the local organizations that PSI works with on internal controls and best financial management practices. As a sub award accountant, I undertook audit and financial assessments of either NGO or international aid funded organizations. I identified capacity building needs of their finance staff and ensured relevant trainings were conducted. It is this passion that has driven every one of my career decisions thus far. I’ll transfer this experience to AAS by providing technical support in the Technical Working Group meetings, workshops and other forums.

•	 Excellent writing and facilitation skills. In my current job, I draft and also review fund proposals from grantees. I also responded to queries from the grantees and this enabled me to critique and ensure quality and consistency of the documents. I’ll transfer this skill to AAS by managing the suppliers who will be providing the technical drafts of the Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP) standard and the development of the GFGP assessment tool.

•	An effective manager. I have an understanding of grants management and articulating clear practical recommendations. In my role at sub award accountant, I managed Sub-grants and integrated programs. I was able to showcase my managerial abilities as a Sub award Accountant in USAID funded project by leading the management of finances and contracts, drafting amendments within the consortium. At Population Services International, I prepared financial reports for donors. In addition, I had the opportunity to analyse spending trends and provided feedback to team leaders on areas with significant over- or under spending, which further shows my dedication to grants management

Dear Sir/ Madam,

Re: Application for the Position of Business Development Manager 

I am writing to apply for the position of Business Development Manager with your organization as advertised on the jobwebkenya.com website. I hold a Masters of Arts degree in International Studies and have eight years work experience in the area of business development. My most recent employment is with the Federation of Kenya Employers, a business membership organization, where I served as a Membership Services Coordinator from September 2013 to January of this year. My role involved dissemination of information to members of the organization as well as potential members, organizing forums for stakeholders and members, drafting periodic reports on member activities and performing all communication related functions within the organization. 

Prior to working with the Federation, I worked with the Kenya Red Cross Society as a business development executive for three years and prior to that with Safaricom Limited. I believe I would be suitably qualified for this role based on my experience and qualifications. Please see attached my CV with greater detail of my qualifications. I look forward to speaking with you about this employment opportunity and can be reached at mukiri7@gmail.com or 0727.872.498.
